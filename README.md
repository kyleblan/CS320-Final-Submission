How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can ensure that my code is both functional and secure by implementing test cases against expected input. 


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

This is typically handled up front before design work starts, and intermittently throughout the process of creating the software/functionality.


How do I approach designing software?

Typically my approach is a minimalistic one, and involves working the requirements thoroughly with the customer, and then pseudo coding those requirements before verifying that I have completed these requirements.
